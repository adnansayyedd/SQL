# Zomato Analysis SQL Project

## üìå Introduction
With the advent of technology, food delivery platforms have revolutionized the dining experience. Services like Zomato allow users to explore, order, and enjoy meals conveniently. However, understanding customer behavior, improving delivery logistics, and optimizing service operations are critical for growth. This project aims to design an analytical framework to study and improve Zomato's operational and customer engagement strategies through a robust database and reporting system.

## üéØ Objectives
- üìä Develop a data-driven analytics platform for food delivery services.
- üîç Identify patterns in customer behavior, order trends, and delivery efficiency.
- üìà Provide actionable insights to improve restaurant partnerships and optimize delivery times.
- ‚≠ê Enhance the user experience by analyzing reviews, ratings, and feedback data.
- üí° Support strategic decision-making for pricing, promotions, and regional expansion.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of multiple tables that store information about restaurants, customers, deliveries, orders, and menu items:
- **üçΩÔ∏è Restaurants**: Stores details like restaurant names, cuisine types, and ratings.
- **üë• Customers**: Contains information about customer names, cities, and order histories.
- **üöö Deliveries**: Records delivery personnel, times, and statuses.
- **üõí Orders**: Tracks order dates, amounts, and statuses.
- **üìú Menu Items**: Includes details about the items offered by each restaurant.

## üîç Problem Statement
- ‚è≥ Inconsistent delivery times leading to customer dissatisfaction.
- üìâ Lack of insights into customer preferences and order trends.
- üö¥ Inefficient allocation of delivery personnel and resources.
- üè™ Limited understanding of restaurant performance and demand fluctuations.
- üíî Difficulty in maintaining customer retention amidst growing competition.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Queries Used
Below are some key SQL queries used for data analysis:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve all cities with the number of customers in each city.
```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM Customers
GROUP BY city;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the total number of menu items available across all restaurants.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_menu_items
FROM Menu_Items;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve details of all orders where the total amount exceeds $50.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE total_amount > 50;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ List the average price of menu items for each restaurant.
```sql
SELECT restaurant_id, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM Menu_Items
GROUP BY restaurant_id;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Identify customers who have placed no orders.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM Orders);
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve the total revenue for a specific restaurant (e.g., restaurant_id = 3).
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders
WHERE restaurant_id = 3;
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Find the top 3 most expensive menu items and their restaurant names.
```sql
SELECT mi.item_name, r.restaurant_name, mi.price
FROM Menu_Items mi
JOIN Restaurants r ON mi.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
ORDER BY mi.price DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve customers who have placed at least one order.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, customer_name
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Orders);
```

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ List all menu items along with their restaurant names.
```sql
SELECT mi.item_name, r.restaurant_name
FROM Menu_Items mi
JOIN Restaurants r ON mi.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id;
```

### üîü Retrieve the names of customers who have ordered from a specific restaurant (e.g., restaurant_id = 2).
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_name
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.restaurant_id = 2;
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Find restaurants that do not have any menu items.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Restaurants
WHERE restaurant_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT restaurant_id FROM Menu_Items);
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve the name of the restaurant with the highest total revenue.
```sql
SELECT r.restaurant_name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Restaurants r ON o.restaurant_id = r.restaurant_id
GROUP BY r.restaurant_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
